### 1, Statement of problem:

In US, millions of people use Zillow to estimate home valuation. It is essential for Zillow to provide consumers with useful and accurate information about homes and the housing market.

Also, starting 2019, Zillow had started buying and selling homes as an agency. Thus, it is more and more important for them to know the value of their own purchases and the profit these properties will generate in the market.

However, each property has hundreds of data points and varys significantly from each other. It is quite difficult to improve the margin of error.
