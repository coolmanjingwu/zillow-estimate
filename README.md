# HW1 Six components of my business use case(Tesla)

## Name: Jingwu Fang



### 1, Statement of problem:

After 10 months of construction, Tesla Gigafactory 3 (Shanghai) started delivering cars by December 2019. On his recent trip to Shanghai(2020/01/07), Elon introduced model Y and mentioned that a new design center would be built in China as well. With the sponsorship from the Chinese government, Tesla is able to lower its Model 3’s price to $43,000, which is a very affordable price for millions of middle class Chinese households. 

With this big market in front of Tesla, there are apparently not enough Tesla charging stations (by 2019/07/04 only 2300 super chargers and 2100 destination chargers) around in the Chinese cities. In order to meet the need of the current Tesla drivers and attract potential buyers, Tesla has to build a good amount of charging stations in a short period of time. But due to the big discrepancies of geography and population density, Tesla will probably have a hard time finding the optimal spot, number, and distribution for its charging stations.
  

### 2, Client:

Tesla, Inc.

### 3, Key Business Question

Are there any models for us to predict optimal Tesla charging station locations, numbers, and distribution for the Chinese market based on various population densities, geography and local GDPs?

### 5, Business Impact of Work:

1, According to its announcement, Tesla China is planning to build more than 4000 super charger in the near future. Each cost around $150,000(conservatively), so that’s in total a roughly $600 million project in China. If we can find the optimal spots and number for Tesla chargers, we will hopefully help Tesla cut some cost by optimizing its charging network.

2, If charging system construction works out nicely and environmental friendly, policy makers are likely to help Tesla grow even more via state-sponsorship, which will induce more buyers in the relevant market.

3,  Meet the increasing need of the current Tesla drivers and attract potential buyers.

### 6, How business will use (predicted) model to make decisions:

1, Help Tesla implement charging stations effective and efficiently.
2, The resulting model will also predict the queue of waiting cars so that Tesla can think of some better ways to entertain its drivers while they are waiting.
3, Indirectly boost the sale of all Tesla models, which will provide Tesla some timely feedback on current and future strategies. 
4, Similar model can be used to study other Asian/South-Eastern Asian markets i.e. Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan etc.
