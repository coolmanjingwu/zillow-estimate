Unit test 1: Set limit on built year. 

      Since our data was from 2016, which means any house that is built after 2016 won't be taken into consideration.

Unit test 2: Set limit on transaction year month.

      Since our data was from 2016, which means any house that is transacted after 201612 won't be taken into consideration.

Unit test 3: 
      Input an invalid built year, see if it will throw error. 

Unit test 4: 
      Input an invalid transaction yearmonth, see if it will throw error. 

Integration test:

      Make a prediction on the log_error(i.e. model output) using unit test1 and unit test2 along with other user inputs.
